----- A simple Particle Designer for OpenFrameworks -----

//////////////////////
// ludimation notes //
//////////////////////
- had to rebuild project and create some functions to make this run properly on my OSX 10.6 mac
- main issues seem to stem from the fact that ofxParticleSystem uses Color4f's for particles
  while ofxGuiToo expects ofFloatColor's (not sure if it's specific to my machine)
